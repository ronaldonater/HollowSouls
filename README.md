# Hollow Souls

*A bizarre descent through a fractured world of forgotten drawings and unique creatures.*

## 🎮 Overview

**Hollow Souls** is a 2D pixel-art action-adventure game that blends atmospheric exploration with reactive melee combat. Players take on the role of **The Creator**, a mysterious figure trapped inside a chaotic world born from his own drawings. Each area—known as a "Canvas"—is a self-contained boss world with unique mechanics, physics, and aesthetics.

With mechanics like **dodging**, **parrying**, **double jumping**, and a **momentum-based dash**, Hollow Souls offers a combat experience that is fluid, precise, and punishingly fair. The game draws inspiration from titles like *Hollow Knight*, *Blasphemous*, and *Hyper Light Drifter* while establishing its own surreal identity.
